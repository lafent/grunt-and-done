grunt-and-done
==============

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a node based static site using:

*   Jade
*   Twitter Bootstrap
*   jQuery

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.
