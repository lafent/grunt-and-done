grunt-and-done
==============

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a static site using:

*   Grunt Tasks
*   Node.js
*   Jade Templates
*   Twitter Bootstrap v3
*   jQuery and jQuery.tablesorter
*   Google Analytics

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.
