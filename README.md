grunt-and-done
==============

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a node based static site using:

*   Jade
*   Twitter Bootstrap
*   jQuery

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.  

When trying to get setup, clone the repo, then just `npm install` to get the
site started.  Finally run `grunt` to get the server up and running.
