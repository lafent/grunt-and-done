grunt-and-done
==============

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a static site using:

*   Grunt Tasks
*   Node.js
*   Jade Templates
*   Twitter Bootstrap v3
*   jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter
*   Google Analytics

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.  

Getting Started
===============

You'll need [git](http://git-scm.com/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and an
internet connection to get things rolling.

1.  `git clone https://github.com/lafent/grunt-and-done.git`
2.  `cd grunt-and-done`
2.  `npm install`
3.  `grunt` 

Now point your browser to [http://localhost:3456/](http://localhost:3456/) and
view your website.

Todo
====

1.  Improve documentation.
2.  ~~Setup production tasks in grunt, including uglify and concat tasks.~~
3.  Look at other grunt tasks that can be inlined.
4.  Look at usemin to handle configuring use of minified versions.
5.  Add other examples from the bootstrap examples page.
6.  Consider other basic libraries to add to the base. *Be critical of utility*

Reminder
========

Please update the ga.js file to include the correct account code.
