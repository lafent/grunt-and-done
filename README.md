grunt-and-done
==============

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a static site using:

*   Grunt Tasks
*   Node.js
*   Jade Templates
*   Twitter Bootstrap v3
*   jQuery and jQuery.tablesorter
*   Google Analytics

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.  

Getting Started
===============

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Run `npm install`
3.  Run `grunt` 
4.  Point your browser to [http://localhost:3456/](http://localhost:3456/) to
    view your website.

Todo
====

1.  Improve documentation.
2.  ~~Setup production tasks in grunt, including uglify and concat tasks.~~
3.  Look at other grunt tasks that can be inlined.
4.  Look at usemin to handle configuring use of minified versions.

Reminder
========

Please update the ga.js file to include the correct account code.
